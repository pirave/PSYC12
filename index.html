d) Age is not a stigma
</code></pre>

<h2>Model of stigma reactions</h2>

<pre><code>Identity threat appraisals
    - Realize you are being viewed as a women/muslim/asian
        - but not as a person
    - 3 Things that predict this
        A) Collective Representations
            Culture, where are you? Canada? Africa?
            Depending on where you are the stereotypes will be different
            Canada + Black vs. Jamaica + Black
        B) Situational Cues
            What is in the immediate enviornment?
            What is around you? What cues communitcate things about your identity
                ex) number of people. (more men than women in the class)
        C) Personal Characteristics
            What is the person like?
            Are they stigma concious?
            Pesonality? Self-esteem
    - 2 Responses
        E) Nonvolitional
            Stress responses.
            Heart rate, sweat, thoughts racing through the mind
        F) Volitional
            Coping responses.
            Things you can do to control it.
            Tell yourself to calm down.
    E+F = Outcome
        make a new friend
        get yelled at

ex) How do Muslims cope at the airport?
Visible cues = Hajab, gown
Muslim man looked really scared, uncomfortable at the airport. Why?
Collective Representation = Toronto, NA, stereotype linking muslims with terrorism
Situational Cue = airport (even more b\c 9/11, history)
Personal Characteristics = seemed devote, wore the garb, he relates strongly with his group.

===&gt; A + B + C =  will make an Identity Threat Appraisal

Stress Response: heart threat beating faster, sweating, thinking, worrying
Coping Response: stood still, looked down -- controled emotions, so noone suspects him

Outcome: 
How is he feelign at the moment?
Scared, worried? 
Health = stress could lead to to premature death
    it's probably unhealthy for them to frequently visit the airport

* Am I being judged because of my group?
Just because you made an identity threat apparaisal doesn't mean you negative outcome

<h2>Stigma's Self-Protective Properties</h2>

<h3>Movie Clip</h3>

<pre><code>Sandra has brown eyes
Raymond has blue eyes
Teacher said blue eye'd kids were smarter, greater, etc than brown eyed people
Brown = sad; Blue = happy;
    showed how easy we can become groupy
    shows us an idea of how it feels to be discriminated against
        the lion vs the hunter

Stigma &amp; Self-Esteem
- they are disadvantage
- they have low self esteem
    Reflected Appraisals: I see myself the way you see me.
    Self-fulfilling Prohpecy: I may act in a way, that confirms what they think of me.
        Confirmation Bias
- Wrong!
    Actually, stigmatized people have the same or higher SE than non-stigmatized
        - e.g. Africans (but not for all other groups)
        - what volutional responses are they having to protect themself
</code></pre>

<h3>Crocker &amp; Major, 1989</h3>

<pre><code>- Stigma can buffer self-esteem
- e.g. How can stigma help you feel NOT bad about yourself?
    Prof thought he didnt get the job because he was stigmatized as a white male.
        - He didnt get the job because he thought minorities and women got the job
        - rejected him because he was white male, his work was amazing
    Actually work wasn't good enough
- 3 effects of stigma, to protect SE
    Attrbutional Ambiguity:
        - Ambigous / many reasons as to why you were discrimated against
            - They have one extra layer of ambiguity. 
                - Your identiy / stigma trait
            - Believe that's the reason
            - extra layers of self protection
        - Blame discrimination vs. blaming self
            - You blame discrimination rather than yourself
        - Discount negative feedback
            - All the bad things that happen to me are because the worlds racists
    Disidentification:
        - Disconnecting your SE from a specific domain
        - stopping to care about domains which you or your group don't do well in
        e.g. Women are not as good in math &amp; engineering
            Women think they don't like math and CS now
            Protects self-esteem they don't have to face negative feedback
    In-group comparions:
        - when I get negative feedback, you compare yourself to your ingroup
            - yea I did bad ... but not as bad as other women
        - Segregated Engviornments: 
            - In toronto, its diverse but there are ethnic pockets.
        - Accurate self-evaluations in the sense you compare yourself with people you like and admire
        - We don't have to deal with other "better" groups
            - stick with our group
Finally, you won't have as low of a self esteem as you ought to have.
</code></pre>

<h3>Crocker et al., 1991</h3>

<pre><code>Stigmatized can protect theire self-esteem by attribuitng negative feedback to prejudice.
Method: 
    - Black and White persons are in separate rooms.
    - Asked to make friends
    - Blinds up = black know white person can see their black
    - Blinds down = black know white person can NOT see their black
Results (look at graph)
    Graph 1:
        - People blame discrimination more when they recieve negative
            - for both seen &amp; unseen
        - People blame discrimination more when they are seen
            - for both positive &amp; negative
    Graph 2:
        - Unseen + Negative feed back = low SE
        - Seen + Negative feed back = no change
        - Unseen + Positive feed back = high SE
        - Seen + Positive feed back = low SE
            What? because of pity
            ex) Girls feel bad because they got hired cuz their a girl not cuz their good enough.
Conclusion: 
    - Attributions to Discrimination can 
        1. buffer SE from Negative feedback
            Discount the feedback so they don't feel bad
        2. hurt SE from Positive feeback
            Affirmative Action
</code></pre>

<h5>i-Clicker</h5>

<pre><code>Crocker et al. found that:
A) * Blacks make attributions to prejudice when their race is known
B) Blacks make attributions to personal merit when race is known
C) After positive feedback, Blacks feel worse about themselves
D) After negative feedback, Blacks feel better about themselves
E) After negative feedback, Blacks feel worse about themselves

According to Major &amp; O'Biren, which of the follwoing does NOT contribute to threat appraisal?
A) Personal characteristics
B) * Volitional responses
c) Situational Cues
D) Collective Representations
E) You brought the dog bowling?
</code></pre>

<h2>Moderating Characteristics</h2>

<h3>Personal Characteristics</h3>

<pre><code>More reasons why we are more likey to make identity threat appraisal

Group Identification:
    - More likely to see your self as a target
    - Interpret ambiguous cues as stigma-relevants
        - could be totally unrelated to discrimination

Domain Identification:
    - The extent to which you care about about a stereotype domain
    - Care about stereotyped domain
    - More liekly to affected by identity threat
    - What if you really like math and your a woman?
        - you may be more likey to make identity threat
        - you feel threatened
</code></pre>

<h3>Stigma Consciousness</h3>

<pre><code>Quote:
    - thinks everything someone does is, because he was an criminal
    - people do nice things because of who I am
    - high stigma consious

- Being sensitive to possibility of being evaluated on basis of stigmatized group membership
- Extent to which one expects to be stereotyped
- Lots of Variations
    - some aren't sensitive
    - more sensitve = more identity threat appraisal
'Some people view the world through a lens'
</code></pre>

<h5>i-Clicker</h5>

<pre><code>Which of the following has NOT been found to be related to reactions to stigma?
a) * Self-esteem (it *may* be a bi-product at the end)
b) Group Identification
c) Stigma Conciousness
d) Domain identification
</code></pre>

<h3>Kaiserm Vick, &amp; Major, 2006</h3>

<pre><code>Uncle Leo Phenomenon
    - People who see prejudice and threats all over the place

Emotional Stroop Task:
    controlled vs. stigmatized
    name the colour, not the read the word

Words 1: sexist (threat)
Words 2: netural (control)

Result:
    - reaction time is longer when the words are sexist
    Graph:
        - Control words were the same for women who were high/low SC
        - High SC woman reacted way slower to threat words
            - They are pre-consciously aware / precieve threats in the enviornment
</code></pre>

<h5>i-Clicker</h5>

<pre><code>What is the take-home message of the Kaiser et al. study?
a) Women high in SC have a hard time naming colours
b) It's fun to have participants in your study say "hooters"
c) Women low in SC are preconsiously aware of threat to their social identity
d) * Woman high in SC are preconsiously aware of threat to their social identity
e) Gender identification is related to SC

<h1>Lecture 7</h1>

<h2>Movie Time!</h2>

<pre><code>Testing of intelligence is complicated but its important
It is the most controversial aspect in psychology
IQ does it really represent it?
Gardner talks about it may be biased. It may not predict things
</code></pre>

<h5>i-Clicker</h5>

<pre><code>Do men and women differ in intellectual ability? (Personal beleif)
a) * Yes
b) No
c) Dunno
</code></pre>

<h5>i-Clicker</h5>

<pre><code>Do whites and asians differ in intellectual ability? (Personal beleif)
a) * Yes
b) No
c) Dunno
</code></pre>

<h5>i-Clicker</h5>

<pre><code>Do whites and blacks differ in intellectual ability? (Personal beleif)
a) Yes
b) * No
c) Dunno
- people were less willing to say yes
</code></pre>

<h2>Group Differences in IQ as Product of Prejudice?</h2>

<h3>Male-Female Math Performance Difference</h3>

<pre><code>People have a decision of whether they make an Identity Threat Apprasals

Numbers above zero means male perform better than female
    - In elementary + JH we favour women
    - As you grow older men are favoured
    - e.g. We see male's dominating in CS &amp; Math
</code></pre>

<h3>Black-White IQ distrubition</h3>

<pre><code>Curves largely overlap 
    - therefore their mostly the same thing
But, there is a diffrence favouring whites over blacks
    - Whites: 105
    - Blacks: 90
</code></pre>

<h3>Ask yourself</h3>

<pre><code>Ask yourself about group differences in "intellectual performancs"
    - Race: B vs W IQ
    - Sex: M vs F Math
    - SES: R vs P IQ

Why are groups different?
    - maybe the IQ tests were written in a europian cultured way
    - maybe SES is because rich have access to more enriched things
        - education / books
        - healthy food
    - who wrote the test? is the dominant group?
    - alot of men are good, alot are bad in math
</code></pre>

<h5>i-Clicker</h5>

<pre><code>Why do groups differ in "intellectual performance"?
a) Not different
b) Tests are unfair
c) * Different Socializing enviornments
d) Genetics
e) Don't want to answer
</code></pre>

<h3>Genetics</h3>

<pre><code>Intelligence is highly heritable
    - If you have smart parents, chances are you smart.
    - If your siblings are smart, changecs are your smart.
    - There is a high correliation btw a parent and childs IQ
        - 0.47 correlations
        - 0 correlation between parents that adopted
    - IQ of identical twins is closer than those of fraternal
</code></pre>

<h3>Enviornment</h3>

<pre><code>- IQ of raised apart is less than IQ of identical twins raised together
    - exact same genetics BUT different enviornment
- IQ of fraternal twins is more strongly related than IQ of regular siblings
    - fraternal are in the same enviornment
- IQ of adopted is more similar than unrelated individuals
    - 0 genetic corellation for both
- Impoversished / Poorer children have lower IQ
    - the longer they're in the poverty enviornments the IQ stays longer
    - Vice Versa
</code></pre>

<h3>Nature vs Nurture?</h3>

<pre><code>Both contribute to intelligence

But genetics certainly plays a role
    - hertiablility index - 0.5 (almost 0.65)

If within-group difference has genetic component, then maybe between-group does too.
    - lets say 50% is determined by genes, can we say:
        - 50% of the difference btw B &amp; W is because of genese
        - M &amp; W, Rich &amp; Poor? 
        - No.
    - So yes, nature plays apart, but it doesnt explain everything.

e.g Seeds anlogy
    Within Group Difference -&gt; Genetics
    Between Group Difference -&gt; Enviornment
</code></pre>

<h3>Why are groups different?</h3>

<pre><code>Does the difference exist?
    The difference gap is decreasing over the years
        - genetics takes long to change
        - therefore environment
    Yes, there is.

Are the tests unfair?
    Are they culturally biased?

    External Bias:
        - Does it predict the same thing for different people? different groups?
        -
